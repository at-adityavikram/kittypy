 <h3 align="center">Requirements</h3>
 <h4 align="center">Please install these modules before using!</h4>

  <li>playsound</li>
  </ul>
 <h3 align="center">CAUTION</h3>
 Windows does not support ANSI console coloration by itself. What this means is that if you execute the example.py or kittypy.py right away, all you'll see is undecipherable glitches. To fix this, you need to install a registy entry (I have prepared a .reg file beforehand to make it easy!). Just download <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UxT_W_8vE_SWhUgg1AQMG8Q-J_Sw5t8I/view?usp=sharing">this file</a> (for some reason google drive labels it as a music file!!??) and run it (right click -> Merge, or simply double click and 'allow').
 Also, NEVER RUN KITTYPY OR ANY KITTYPY GAME IN THE IDLE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR GAME TO (A)BE SLOW AND (B)LOOK LIKE THE SPAWN OF SATAN. PLEASE RUN THESE DIRECTLY BY DOUBLE CLICKING ON THE FILES, OR LAUNCHING CMD IN THE FOLDER AND TYPING 'python name_of_game.py'.
 Happy gaming!<br><br>
 <b>PS: the music is the theme of the most sold* video game of all time - Tetris! (fun fact: the tetris theme is a chiptune remix of –ö–æ—Ä–æ–±–µÃÅ–π–Ω–∏–∫–∏ (korobienki), which is a russian folk song!)</b>
