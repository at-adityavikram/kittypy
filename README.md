<h4 align="center">A light, simple game engine for ASCII graphic games. Create your own console games easily!<br>
Complete with scene manager and switcher, 'collision' detection (with a char, point, edge or box), character sprite switcher and movement manager, support for color, splash screen, in-game music and more.</h4><br>
<h3 align="center">Alpha Released!</h3>
<h3 align="center">How to use</h3>
<ul><li>Download the whole repo and extract everything from the zip, making sure all of them are in the same folder.
  <li>Run kptest.py - it is a very simple example 'game' built on kittypy</li>
  <li>Test out the example, and try to build your own game. Remember to import kittypy!</li>
 </ul>
 <h3 align="center">CAUTION</h3>
 Windows does not support ANSI console coloration by itself. What this means is that if you execute the example.py or kittypy.py right away, all you'll see is undecipherable glitches. To fix this, you need to install a registy entry (I have prepared a .reg file beforehand to make it easy!). Just download <a href="download/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/at-adityavikram/neptune/master/enablecolor.reg" download="enable_color_in_terminal.reg">this file</a> and run it (right click -> Merge, or simply double click and 'allow').
 Also, NEVER RUN KITTYPY OR ANY KITTYPY GAME IN THE IDLE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR GAME TO (A)BE SLOW AND (B)LOOK LIKE THE SPAWN OF SATAN. PLEASE RUN THESE DIRECTLY BY DOUBLE CLICKING ON THE FILES, OR LAUNCHING CMD IN THE FOLDER AND TYPING 'python name_of_game.py'.
 Happy gaming!
